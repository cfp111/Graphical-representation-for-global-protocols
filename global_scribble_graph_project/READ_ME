Hello,
You will find here some information about the project global_scribble_graph.

First, you need to install Pydot as a Python package. 
This can be found in: http://code.google.com/p/pydot/downloads/list
Furthermore, Pydot requires also: 
pyparsing in order to load DOT files (http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/),
Graphviz to render the graphs (http://www.graphviz.org/). 

Second, you need to install ANTLR. 
The Python runtime environment can be found in http://www.antlr.org/download/Python

The project is divided into 2 folders:
 - protocols: there are examples of Scribble global protocols.
 - src: the scribbleToGraph file allows to get the graph from a Scribble global protocol.
 		the graphToScribble file allows to get the Scribble global protocol from the graph, 
 		both will be written in files.
 		the testCreation file allows to specified graph that will be executed in the test file.
 		- ext: 	it is the Python file with the graph objects. 
 				This file extended the pydot library.
 				So it is important to have installed pydot and also graphviz in order to use it.
 		- antlr_pydot: there are the files to parse a Scribble protocol with time constraints and delays.
 
To generate a graph from a global protocol in Scribble (.spr file),
you need to specify the file,
and then run the main method in scribbleToGraph.py in the Source package of the project.

To generate a global protocol in Scribble from a graph,
you need to first create the graph.
You can use for this purpose the file graphCreation.py in the Source package.
Then you need to run the main method in graphToScribble.py in the Source package as well.

If you use ANTLRWorks to generate the files, 
ANTLRWorks 1.2.2 allows generating the files in Python,
ANTLRWorks 1.3 allows debugging grammars.
Do not use other updated versions, it may not work.
